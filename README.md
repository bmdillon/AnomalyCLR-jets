# AnomalyCLR-jets
A codebase for AnomalyCLR-jets, learning representations for anomaly detection in LHC jets.  Based on a self-supervised contrastive-learning technique developed for JetCLR and AnomalyCLR.

The anomaly-augmentations are designed to produce representations sensitive to:
 - semi-visible jets from dark matter models
 - multi-prong jets from the decay of heavy particles within the jets
